## About:
This repo will be used for, in my opinion, mostly practice with markdown and Github Pages. Additionally, it will help us think about what we are doing by having us post links on a website, having us think about what tools are required of us to work our way through the assignment, having us find/supply useful webpages we (ourselves and our classmates) could use for learning help.
