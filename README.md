## About:
This repo will be used for, in my opinion, mostly practice with markdown and Github Pages. Additionally, it will help us think about what we are doing by having us post links on a website, having us think about what tools are required of us to work our way through the assignment, having us find/supply useful webpages we (ourselves and our classmates) could use for learning help. 

## Recommended Tools & Languages:
There are several tools that you might need to publish a repo with Github Pages. I will say that I do not think you necessarily need any languages due to its simplicity, but, if one wanted, one could probably use different languages to increase the ability of the website.

### Tools:
- Github\
This one is obvious, but it is still needed
- A Git tool to communicate local or cloud changes to the other. Possible options are listed below:
    - Github Desktop: can be very simple to use, has a specific button on Github repos, and has a GUI (download at https://desktop.github.com/)
    - TortoiseGit: works with the Windows file manager to work many Git actions on the files and folders (download at https://tortoisegit.org/)
    - Git Bash: works with Github, but is set up mostly like the command line (download WITH https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.13.3.windows.1/Git-2.13.3-64-bit.exe)
- A web browser\
Take your pick, but you need one to access the page you make

### Languages:
As I said before, you do not really need a language to *publish* a repo. However, there are languages one can use to increase the capabilities.
- Markdown
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- PHP

## Recommended Resources:
- https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/index.html \
This one is not specifically about web development, but is a damn good site to help one with Markdown that I discovered and used last year to help myself
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn \
I have not used this one, but it looks like a great resource to learn (free), and one can even earn certifications on it
- https://www.codecademy.com/ \
I used this a couple years ago to teach myself HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScipt for an internship I had
